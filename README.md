# MOS Capacitor Fabrication using Al₂O₃

## 📌 Introduction

* Fabrication of MOS capacitor using **Al₂O₃ dielectric** instead of conventional SiO₂.
* Demonstrates improved dielectric constant, low leakage current, and strong interface quality.

## 🎯 Objective

* To design and fabricate a MOS capacitor using **RF sputtering (Al₂O₃ deposition)** and **thermal evaporation (Al contacts)**.
* To perform **C–V characterization** and analyze device performance.

## ⚙️ Methodology / Steps

1. **Cutting & Cleaning**

   * Wafer cutting with diamond cutter.
   * Cleaning using **Piranha solution, RCA-1, RCA-2, HF cleaning** to remove contaminants and native oxides.

2. **Deposition of Al₂O₃ (Dielectric Layer)**

   * Performed **RF Sputtering** under high vacuum (\~10⁻⁶ Torr).
   * Maintained gas flow (Ar + O₂) and optimized RF power for uniform deposition.

3. **Deposition of Aluminium (Metal Contacts)**

   * **Thermal Evaporation** used to deposit Al electrodes.
   * Achieved thin film uniformity and low-resistance contacts.

4. **C–V Characterization**

   * Used **Keysight Semiconductor Characterization System (SCS)**.
   * Bias sweep: -4 V to +4 V at 100 kHz.
   * Results: High capacitance density, low leakage, strong Si–Al₂O₃ interface.

## 📊 Results

* Capacitance range: **3.5×10⁻¹⁰ F (accumulation) to 1.0×10⁻¹⁰ F (inversion)**.
* Threshold Voltage: **\~0.88 V**
* Flat Band Voltage: **\~1.29 V**
* Al₂O₃ showed superior dielectric constant and reduced leakage compared to SiO₂.

## ✅ Conclusion

* Successfully fabricated MOS capacitor using Al₂O₃.
* Demonstrated strong electrical performance and reliability, validating Al₂O₃ as a **promising high-k dielectric** for next-gen CMOS technologies.
